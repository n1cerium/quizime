# Quizime

Quizime is a web application where users have different anime quiz to guess. They can either guess the title of the anime, the character's name, which top # the anime falls in (either popularity or rank), the theme song of the anime, or which voice actor or actress voices the characters. The application uses [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe) to fetch those anime data. The app is published through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_medium=paid_search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=GS_Connect:+Netlify+Brand&utm_term=netlify)
